## Akshaj Verma

I enjoy writing code using `Python`, `R`, and `Javascript`. Into `computer vision` and `deep learning`.

I worked on time series forecasting and NLP as a data scientist at KPMG for a while. Had a lot of fun developing an R package called 'NNbenchmark' during Google Summer of Code in 2019. Founded a student group called 'Data Science Club' in my university to promote and study applied data science. Love Manchester United, Bob Dylan, and ATLA.
